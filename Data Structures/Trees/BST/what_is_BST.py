WHAT IS IT?

Its a tree that maintains the property that the value in each node must be greater than 
or equal to any value stored in the left sub-tree and less than or equal to any value stored in the right subtree

Eveything on left is less than root and right subtree
Evetything on right is greater than root and left subtree

Time Complexity:
    Access: O(log(n))
    Search: O(log(n))
    Insert: O(log(n))
    Remove: O(log(n))
