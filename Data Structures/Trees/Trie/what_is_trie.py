WHAT IS IT?

Trie aka radix or prefix tree. 
It is a kind of search tree that is used to store a dynamic set or associative array
where the keys are usually Strings.
No node in the tree stores the key assocated with that node, instead the node's position 
is used to define what key it will be associated with

All descendants of a ndoe have a common prefix of the string associated with that node
and the root is associated with the empty string
